# Installation Guide
Get your own SMBIOS, download your desired macOS version (I reccomend anything older than Sonoma because Nooted Red doesn't play nicely). After installing macOS add Nooted Red for graphics acceleration and done
# Tip for Sonoma and newer
Before adding Nooted Red make sure to change your wallpaper to something static since Nooted Red doesn't play nicely with live or dynamic wallpapers
